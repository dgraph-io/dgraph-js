# Mutual TLS example project

Project demonstrating the use of [dgraph-js][] and Dgraph set up with client-server
mutual TLS. The following guide shows how to set up a single-group two-node
cluster (1 Dgraph Zero and 1 Dgraph Alpha) configured with mutual TLS.

[dgraph-js]:https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-js

## Running

### Install Dgraph

You will need to [install Dgraph v20.03.0 or
above](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases) and run it.

A quick-start installation script is available for Linux and Mac:

```sh
curl -sSf https://get.dgraph.io | bash
```

### Create TLS certificates

Dgraph provides a `dgraph cert` tool to create and manage self-signed
server and client certificates using a generated Dgraph Root CA. See the [TLS
documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#tls-configuration) for more
information.

Create the root CA. All certificates and keys are created in the `tls` directory.

```sh
dgraph cert
```

Now create the Alpha server certificate (node.crt) and key (node.key) and client
certificate (client.user.crt) key (client.user.key).

```sh
dgraph cert -n localhost
```

```sh
dgraph cert -c user
```

The following files should now be in the `tls` directory:

```sh
$ ls tls
ca.crt  ca.key  client.user.crt  client.user.key  node.crt  node.key
```

Using `dgraph cert ls` provides more details about each file. For instance, it
shows that the `node.crt` is valid only for the host named `localhost` and the
corresponding file permissions.

```sh
$ dgraph cert ls
-rw-r--r-- ca.crt - Dgraph Root CA certificate

```

### Start Dgraph cluster

Start Dgraph Zero:

```sh
dgraph zero
```

Start Dgraph Alpha with TLS options. `REQUIREANDVERIFY` sets mutual TLS (server authentication and client authentication):

```sh
dgraph alpha --lru_mb=1024 --zero=localhost:5080 --tls_dir=./tls --tls_client_auth=REQUIREANDVERIFY
```

### Run example

Ensure the dgraph-js client is installed by running the following within this
example directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run the example

```sh
node index.js
```

Your output should look something like this (uid values may be different):

```console
Created person named "Alice" with uid = 0x7569

All created nodes (map from blank node names to uids):
alice => 0x7569
dg.1310839545.1 => 0x756a
dg.1310839545.2 => 0x756b
dg.1310839545.3 => 0x756c

Number of people named "Alice": 1
{ uid: '0x7569',
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 26,
  married: true,
  loc: { type: 'Point', coordinates: [ 1.1, 2 ] },
  dob: '1980-02-01T17:30:00Z',
  friend: [ { name: 'Bob', age: 24 }, { name: 'Charlie', age: 29 } ],
  school: [ { name: 'Crown Public School' } ] }

DONE!
```
