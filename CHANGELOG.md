## [v2.0.0] - 2019-09-06

### Added
- `doRequest` function for performing upsert, or just a query or a mutation
- Support for ACL features in Dgraph v1.1 - login & jwt refresh
- `upsert` and `lang` fields to proto message type SchemaNode
- Option for server-side sequencing

### Fixed
- Pass `metadata` and `options` arguments to `Txn#discard` in `Txn#mutate`

## [v1.2.0] - 2018-03-12

### Added
- **[BREAKING]** Optional `metadata` parameter of type `grpc.Metadata` to the
  `DgraphClientStub` methods. `options` parameter moved to the third position
  to conform to the `grpc` package API.

  Methods affected - `DgraphClient#alter`, `Txn#query`, `Txn#queryWithVars`,
  `Txn#mutate`, `Txn#commit` and `Txn#discard`.

  To upgrade to this version, if using any of these methods with the `options`
  parameter, simply add a `null` argument before the `options` argument. For
  example, `client.alter(options)` becomes `client.alter(null, options)`
